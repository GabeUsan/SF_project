This is my very first project in Python.

With this project I want to evaluate the impact of homeless on businesses' relocation decisions in San Francisco. 
I am cleaning and manipulating the data, trying to understand the data I need.
I found two datasets: one includes business in SF with start and end date and the other includes reports (311 cases). 
I want to build a survival model and a regression model.
